this is a boxlib i/o test.
it writes and reads a multifab.

Usage:
iotest3d.Linux.g++.gfortran.MPI.ex inputsfile
   [nfiles            = nfiles   ]
   [maxgrid           = maxgrid  ]
   [ncomps            = ncomps   ]
   [nboxes            = nboxes   ]
   [nsleep            = nsleep   ]
   [ntimes            = ntimes   ]
   [raninit           = tf       ]
   [mb2               = tf       ]
   [rbuffsize         = rbsize   ]
   [wbuffsize         = wbsize   ]
   [groupsets         = tf       ]
   [setbuf            = tf       ]
   [nfileitertest     = tf       ]
   [dssnfileitertest  = tf       ]
   [filetests         = tf       ]
   [dirtests          = tf       ]
   [testwritenfiles   = versions ]
   [testreadmf        = tf       ]
   [readFANames       = fanames  ]
   [nreadstreams      = nrs      ]
   [usesingleread     = tf       ]
   [usesinglewrite    = tf       ]
   [checkfpositions   = tf       ]
   [checkfmf          = tf       ]
   [pifstreams        = tf       ]
   [usedss            = tf       ]
   [usesyncreads      = tf       ]
   [nmultifabs        = nmf      ]
   [dirname           = dirname  ]



the range [1,nprocs] is enforced for nfiles.
ncomps is the number of FAB components.
nboxes is the number of boxes in the multifab.
nsleep will sleep for nsleep seconds.
ntimes is the number of times to run the test.
raninit will initialize the multifab with random values.
mb2 will use 2^20 instead of 1.0e+06 to calculate megabytes.
rbuffsize sets the read  buffer size
wbuffsize sets the write buffer size
writeminmax writes fab min and max values into the raw native format
dirname will write multifabs to dirname/Level_n where n is [0,nmultifabs)


example run:

mpiexec -n 4 iotest3d.Linux.g++.gfortran.MPI.ex inputs.dssmf nfiles=4 maxgrid=64 ncomps=16 nboxes=32 ntimes=4 raninit=true mb2=true
